The cleaned CSV versions of these data are provided by courtesy of the Scikit-HEP project and are part of the Particle Python module which inspired us to create a similar package for the Julia Language. Corpusles.jl is by far not as feature complete as Particle, but we add functionality continuously, as needed.
